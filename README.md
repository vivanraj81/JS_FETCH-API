# Kalvium Project-Builder | JS | WEATHER FORECAST

We have learned all the important concepts in JavaScript. Now lets work with our project builder in building a Weather forcast app, applying all of the concepts we have just learned.

## How to approach this lab:

There are no test cases for this lab - you just need to complete the task given below and compare the your output with the image provided below.
As there are no test cases - so you are free to explore and experiment with your frontend skills -- keeping in mind -> the basic and required functionality mentioned below **must** be achieved -- only after that you are free to show-off your frontend skills!

### To Do: GET MY API

Create an account in (https://openweathermap.org/). Once you create an account, go to settings and get your API.

### Progression 1: WHAT'S THE WEATHER

Use Fetch to **fetch** the data from openweathermap api and display it as shown in the output.
